# Australian_Weather_Forecast

 In this project, my aim is to determine if there will be rainfall in Australia tomorrow.
 
 I utilize Python and Scikit-Learn to apply Logistic Regression.
 
 My approach involves constructing a classifier to anticipate rainfall occurrences in Australia for the following day.
 
 I employ Logistic Regression to train a binary classification model, utilizing the Rain in Australia dataset for this analysis.
